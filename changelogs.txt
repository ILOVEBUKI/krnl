[+] You should be able to inject into multiple processes without the "Krnl is already injected" message anymore
Note from IceBear: As you all know Krnl currently has 4 checkpoints to get the key; however, we do not enable the extension option on Linkvertise.

I have been thinking of changing this to 2 checkpoints but enabling extension on the links.

We will most likely give it a test run sometime soon.

To clarify: the extension option on linkvertise makes you add a trusted linkvertise extension to your browser, this can be removed after completing the linkvertise.
